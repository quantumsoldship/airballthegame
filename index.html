        <h2>Welcome to Airball</h2>
        <p class="intro-description">
          Airball is a fun and exciting game where two players face off on opposite sides of the court trying to outplay their opponent with strong, strategic hits. Airball is played using a volleyball, hitting it twice for every shot. The game combines elements of four-square, tennis, dodgeball and volleyball to create a unique, entertaining experience that is still easy to play. Anyone can learn airball, anyone can play airball, and anyone can ref airball! The basic concept paired with complex strategy leads to a sporting experience unlike anything else.

      <h2>How to Play Airball</h2>
      <p>Airball is an engaging and dynamic outdoor game that emphasizes skill, strategy, and physical activity, making it suitable for players of all ages.</p>
      <p>Players face off on opposite sides of a court, with the server hitting the ball in the air before sending it over and the receiver using two hits after one bounce to return it. Points are awarded when opponents fail to return the ball properly.</p>

      <h3>Setup</h3>
      <p>Create a court by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Drawing a rectangle on a flat, hard surface: 24 feet long by 16 feet wide</li>
        <li>Leaving at least 10 feet of empty space around all sides</li>
        <li>Drawing a line down the middle to create two equal halves</li>
        <li>Drawing a "spiking line" on each side, 7 feet from the middle line</li>
        <li>Creating three equal zones (5'4" each) on both sides of the middle line</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="court-diagram">
        <img src="court.png" alt="Airball Court Diagram">
      </div>

      <h3>1. Gameplay</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The receiving player must let the ball bounce once, then return it with two hits (one hit in the air, followed by one hit to the other side).</li>
        <li>If a player:
          <ul>
            <li>Touches the ball before it bounces,</li>
            <li>Fails to hit the ball twice, or</li>
            <li>Hits it out of bounds,</li>
            <li>The opponent scores a point.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If the ball lands <strong>on the line</strong>, the play is redone.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Serving</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The server must stand with both feet stationary in square A, toss the ball upward, and hit it twice toward the opponent's side.</li>
        <li>The opponent gets a point if the server:
          <ul>
            <li>Moves their feet</li>
            <li>Serves from the wrong box</li>
            <li>Sits or crouches (no severe bending or squatting)</li>
            <li>Bounces the ball before serving</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Spiking</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Hits must be <strong>upward</strong> unless:
          <ul>
            <li>The ball is hit from the spiking box directly in front of you</li>
            <li>No part of your arm/hand goes above your shoulder</li>
            <li>The second bounce stays within the court's side boundaries (it may go beyond front/back boundaries)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>This is called a spike.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. General Rules</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>All hits must be forceful. No soft touches or drop shots.</li>
        <li>The second bounce must land on the opponent's side of the court.</li>
        <li>You may not step on the opponent's side of the court.</li>
        <li>Players may overturn a referee's call through mutual consent if both players clearly saw and agree on what happened.</li>
      </ul>
